# Why this repository?
If you aren't interested in my personal reasons behind making this repo, you can skip ahead to the next section.

Last year in college I had an assignment about the Hungarian algorithm. It wasn't covered in any courses and the description given to us was pretty vague at best. It contained the common matrix-based explaination you can find in a lot of places online. It works pretty well when a human does it by hand, but it contains unclear steps for a computer which are not easy to solve. In fact, solving those steps lies at the core of the Hungarian algorithm.

While researching this topic online, I came across a lot of bad versions of the algorithm (using even greedy approaches for certain steps), or ones which were unclear. After hours of documenting, I also noticed that I had built almost no intuition for why this algorithm would work, as most sources just offered the algorithm steps without much of an explaination.

I come from a background of competitive programming, where it's crucial to really understand your algorithms, and I think anyone in the field of computer science should try to build some sort of intuition for why certain algorithms work (I'm not saying you have to be able to present a rigurous mathematical proof, but just to be able to grasp the intuition). Some good resources I found were on [infoarena.ro](https://infoarena.ro/algoritm-kuhn), [e-maxx.ru](http://e-maxx.ru/algo/assignment_hungary) and, to my surprise, [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/wiki/hungarian-matching/).
